==Overview==

Just a small Firebird UDF library written in FPC. The Firebird UDF interface would hopefully be obsoleted in Firebird v3.0 and replaced with the new External Engine API. Until then, I hope you find this little library helpful. Any feedback is welcome and appreciated.

Here's the [http://code.google.com/p/firebird-fpc-udfs/source/browse/fpc_udf.sql list of UDFs], and [http://code.google.com/p/firebird-fpc-udfs/source/browse/fpc_udf_utf8.sql additional UTF-8 functions].

==Status==

The functions are tested and work on Win32 and Linux32 platforms.
For installation instructions, read [http://code.google.com/p/firebird-fpc-udfs/source/browse/INSTALL.TXT INSTALL.TXT].

For tips on how to write UDFs for Firebird yourself, read the UDF writing tips on the firebird-lua-udfs project website: http://code.google.com/p/firebird-lua-udfs/wiki/UdfWritingTips.

PS: I have another lil'project for writing UDFs in Lua hosted at http://code.google.com/p/firebird-lua-udfs/.
