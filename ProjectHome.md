## Overview ##

Just a small Firebird UDF library written in FPC. The Firebird UDF interface would hopefully be obsoleted in Firebird v3.0 and replaced with the new External Engine API. Until then, I hope you find this little library helpful. Feedback welcome.

Here's the [list of UDFs](http://code.google.com/p/firebird-fpc-udfs/source/browse/fpc_udf.sql), and [additional UTF-8 functions](http://code.google.com/p/firebird-fpc-udfs/source/browse/fpc_udf_utf8.sql).

## Status ##

The functions are tested and work on Win32 and Linux32 platforms.
For installation instructions, read [INSTALL.TXT](http://code.google.com/p/firebird-fpc-udfs/source/browse/INSTALL.TXT).

For tips on how to write UDFs for Firebird yourself, read the UDF writing tips on the firebird-lua-udfs project website: http://code.google.com/p/firebird-lua-udfs/wiki/UdfWritingTips.

PS: I have another lil'project for writing UDFs in Lua hosted at http://code.google.com/p/firebird-lua-udfs/.
